# openCV- is a library of functions that enables facial recognition from photos and video streams. I will add more to this as I explore this library. 
The lena image has been scanned and a face detection was successful. Since we specified the frontal xml file the face detection currently works only for frontal face images, so side images of faces will not scan, nor will images of non humans.
