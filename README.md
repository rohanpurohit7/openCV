# openCV- is a library of functions that enables facial recognition from photos and video streams. Basic face recognition features are available today in many dslr' cameras where they are integrated with the autofocus features. Sony a6000 for example has a continuous autofocus with face recognition and prioritization feature, so depending on your preference you can direct the camera to focus on a particular face in all your shots.

The lena image has been scanned and a face detection was successful. Since we specified the frontal xml file the face detection currently works only for frontal face images, so side images of faces will not scan, nor will images of non humans.
